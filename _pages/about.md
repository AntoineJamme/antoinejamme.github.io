#  Hi, welcome to my page

I'm **Antoine Jamme**, co-founder and hardware engineer at [OMGrab](https://isaacery.github.io/), where we're building the future of robotics training data collection through smartglasses and data infrastructure.

At **OMGrab** I'm designing **robotics-grade smartglasses** that capture high-quality human point-of-view demonstrations. My work spans the entire hardware development lifecycle - from component selection and circuit design to CAD modeling, prototyping, and firmware programming.

Our mission is to close the training data gap between robotics and language by making it easier to collect massive-scale human demonstrations. The smartglasses I design contain robotics-grade cameras and sophisticated data infrastructure that enables large model training for next-generation AI systems.

I hold a **Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering** and currently work as a Mechanical Engineer at Fortrend Engineering Corporation. There I led the mechanical design and development of the [Lamina 200mm Wafer Sorter/EFEM](/portfolio/portfolio-1/), an industrial robot designed to optimize wafer handling and sorting operations in semiconductor manufacturing.

During my free time, I enjoy hiking & skiing in the Sierra Nevada, surfing along the coast, or kiteboarding inside the bay.
