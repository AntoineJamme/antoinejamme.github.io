#  Hi, welcome to my page

I'm **Antoine Jamme**, co-founder and hardware engineer at [OMGrab](https://isaacery.github.io/), where we're building the future of robotics training data collection through smartglasses and data infrastructure.

At **OMGrab**, I lead the hardware development efforts, focusing on creating **robotics-grade smartglasses** that capture high-quality human point-of-view demonstrations. My work spans the entire hardware development lifecycle - from component selection and circuit design to CAD modeling, prototyping, and firmware programming. I specialize in bringing complex embedded systems from concept to production, ensuring our smartglasses meet the demanding requirements for **large-scale robot training data collection**.

Our mission is to close the training data gap between robotics and language by making it easier to collect massive-scale human demonstrations. The smartglasses I design contain robotics-grade cameras and sophisticated data infrastructure that enables large model training for next-generation AI systems.

I hold a **Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering** and have extensive experience in hardware design, embedded systems, and bringing innovative engineering solutions from concept to production.

During my free time, I enjoy hiking & skiing in the Sierra Nevada, surfing along the coast, or kiteboarding inside the bay.
