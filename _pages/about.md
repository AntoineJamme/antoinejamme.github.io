# 
I'm **Antoine Jamme**, co-founder and hardware engineer at [OMGrab](https://isaacery.github.io/), where we're building the future of robotics training data collection through smartglasses and data infrastructure.

At **OMGrab** I'm designing **robotics-grade smartglasses** that capture high-quality human point-of-view demonstrations. My work spans the entire hardware development lifecycle - from component selection and circuit design to CAD modeling, prototyping, and firmware programming.

I hold a **Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering** and currently work as a Mechanical Engineer at Fortrend Engineering Corporation. There I led the mechanical and electrical design and development of various robots and automation systems in semiconductor manufacturing.

During my free time, I enjoy hiking & skiing in the Sierra Nevada, surfing along the coast, or kiteboarding inside the bay.
