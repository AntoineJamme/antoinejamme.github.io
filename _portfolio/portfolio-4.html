<h3>Key Contributions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Connector Design & Development</strong>: Designed, machined, and prototyped 6 different sizes of plumbing connectors for automated building assembly systems</li>
  <li><strong>Structural Connector Innovation</strong>: Developed and prototyped a novel structural connector system that enables rapid building assembly</li>
  <li><strong>Patent-Generating Work</strong>: Both the plumbing connector system and structural connector designs resulted in granted patents, demonstrating significant technical innovation and intellectual property creation</li>
  <li><strong>Prototyping & Testing</strong>: Led the complete design-to-prototype process, from initial concept through machining and functional testing</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing Integration</strong>: Designed connectors specifically for integration with automated building manufacturing processes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technology Innovation</h3>

<p>ACE Build Automation is transforming traditional construction by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manufacturing buildings in large subsections in controlled factory environments</li>
  <li>Using powerful automated equipment instead of mobile subpar tools</li>
  <li>Dramatically reducing construction time while increasing building quality</li>
  <li>Eliminating waste from subcontractor delays, labor shortages, weather delays, and cost overruns</li>
  <li>Improving safety by moving construction to controlled factory environments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Expertise</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Connector Design & Prototyping</strong>: Complete design-to-prototype process for plumbing and structural connectors</li>
  <li><strong>Precision Machining</strong>: Hands-on machining and manufacturing of prototype connector systems</li>
