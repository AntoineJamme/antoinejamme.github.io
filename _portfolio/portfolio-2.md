### Project Overview

Contributed to the development of KLA-Tencor's [FlashScan™ reticle blank inspection product line](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kla-tencor-announces-new-flashscan-product-line-for-inspection-of-optical-and-euv-reticle-blanks-300504783.html), a groundbreaking system for inspecting reticle blanks used in optical and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. This project marked KLA-Tencor's entry into the dedicated reticle blank inspection market, leveraging decades of expertise in semiconductor inspection technology.

### Key Contributions

* **Precision Inspection Systems**: Designed mechanical components for high-sensitivity reticle blank inspection systems
* **EUV Technology Integration**: Developed hardware solutions for detecting defects on EUV reticle blanks, addressing critical challenges in next-generation lithography
* **High-Throughput Design**: Engineered systems balancing sensitivity requirements with production speed demands
* **Multi-Channel Detection**: Contributed to mechanical design supporting three-channel defect detection, classification, and sizing capabilities

### Technical Innovation

The FlashScan systems leverage laser scattering technology to inspect reticle blanks for:
- **Defect Detection**: Captures pinholes in photoresist, fall-on particles, and various defect types on bare substrates and absorber films
- **EUV Blank Inspection**: Addresses the challenge of manufacturing defect-free EUV blanks, critical for next-generation chip production
- **High Sensitivity**: Superior defect detection capabilities compared to other systems on the market
- **Broad Coverage**: Meets requirements for all optical and EUV blanks in production or development

### Industry Impact

"Advanced lithography begins with a well-characterized reticle blank. Defect-free EUV blanks have been notoriously difficult to manufacture, driving up costs and delaying the benefits that EUV lithography may bring to next-generation chip manufacturing." - Dr. Yalin Xiong, General Manager, Reticle and Broadband Plasma Wafer Inspection Division, KLA-Tencor

The FlashScan product line accelerates cycles of learning for blank manufacturers and mask shops, enabling:
- Improved defect control during process development and volume manufacturing
- Enhanced incoming inspection and process monitoring for reticle manufacturers
- Advancement of EUV lithography technology for next-generation semiconductors
